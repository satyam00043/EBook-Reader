1. Real-Time Messaging
Protocol: WebSocket for persistent bi-directional communication.

Message Flow:

Clients connect via WebSocket to a load-balanced gateway.

Messages are routed to the Chat Service, which handles publishing/subscribing to channels.

Redis Streams or Kafka used for temporary message queuing during peak loads.

2. AI Features
Natural Language Processing (NLP):

Intent recognition and entity extraction using transformer models (e.g., BERT).

Sentiment analysis for auto-triggering support workflows.

Smart Replies:

Fine-tuned LLM (e.g., Llama 3) generates context-aware suggestions using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

Automated Moderation:

ML model flags inappropriate content using keyword matching + semantic analysis.
